I used <a href="http://www.zotero.org/" onClick="recordOutboundLink(this, 'Outbound Links', 'zotero');retur nfalse;">Zotero</a> to collect and manage the references for
SVO. Unfortunately, the bulk of the material in the bibliography
either require expensive subscriptions to access online or is not
online at all.  However, you should be able to access all the material
through inter-library loan at your local public library. If you need
assistance in securing any of these resources, or want to add to or
edit this collection, <a href="mailto:fgregg@gmail.com">email me</a>.

## Data
Compilation of physical and chemical properties of various
vegetable oils and fats reported in the literature. if you want to add to or edit this data, <a href="mailto:fgregg@gmail.com">email me</a>.

* [Fatty Acid Profiles of Various Oils and Fats](fatty_acid.html)
* [Fuel Properties of Various Oils and Fats](fuel_property.html)
* [Viscosity of Vegetable Oils at Different Temperatures](viscosity.html)
* [Density of Vegetable Oils at Different Temperatures](density.html)

## Corrections and Errata
Please send suggested corrections and possible errors to <a href="mailto:fgregg@gmail.com">fgregg@gmail.com</a>.

* On page 53, the page ends with: "The bulk modulus is important
  because, together with specific gravity, it determines the speed at
  which a pressure wave moves through the fluid.  The equation for
  this is:" But no equation appears.

  The equation is

  speed of pressure wave = sqrt(bulk modulus/specific gravity)
