In early 2000s, I was mainly reading two main ideas about what the internet was going to mean for society. First, the internet would level the differences in power between institutions and people. Second, that the internet would enable the formation of communities specialized around interests and identities, unbounded by geography.

I want to talk a bit about the first levelling argument, and the political vision behind it.

The levelling argument went something like this. Before the internet, the ability to widely publish information, opinion, and perspectives was held only by a limited number of institutions. This monopolistic control of information provided the power to control what was on the public agenda as well as how the public thought about issues of public concern. This control gave these institutions power over public outcomes.

Because of the internet, everyone would have the power to publish information, opinion, and perspectives. Conversely, those seeking information, opinion, and perspectives would have the widest selection to choose from. The monopoly was broken.

What interests me today is what lays behind the leveling argument. This argument assumes a basic conflict in our social and political life. On one side are people and on the other side are institutions. Wide differences in power between institutions and people undermines freedom and democratic self-determination. Reducing those differences would make us more free and, almost tautologically, more
democratic.

The levelling argument was not just a description of a likely social chage, but an invitation to participate in that levelling -- a movement for liberation.

It was a call I responded to, and it is a call that I think motivated much of field in open data, open source, open gov, and transparency work.

We believed that information technologies really had a chance to give individual people more power over instutions.

And, we believed that was a good thing.

The past 15 years have instructed me otherwise. The conflicts of our time between an undifferentiated people and powerful organizations, but conflict amongst social groups, classes, and institutions. 

And so, I don't want people to be strong and instiutions weak. I want labor unions to be strong, and the Koch network to be weak. I want the EFF to be strong and the RIAA to be weak. I want bond funds to be strong and the Fraternal Order of Police to be weak.

For the instutions that I do support, I do want them to be democratically controlled and accountable, but that is also a different project that levelling of power.

The vision of individual empowerment split up the world the wrong way. It has led to work that was largely irrelevant and sometimes pernicious.
