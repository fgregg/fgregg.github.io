# Police, Public Safety, and Criminal Justice 

Nationally, we are in the beginning phase of a new civil rights
movement about how we police people of color. In our city
and state, the currents of this movement are strong.

* A fiscal crisis that lets traditional law and order politicians
  be "smart on crime" and support alternative policies to current,
  expensive public safety policies.
* Active, public effort by the County and Sheriff to reduce
  incarceration.
* Local policy leaders in Restorative Justice and youth violence
* High capacity for research into public safety
  interventions by the Crimelab
* A growing, sophisticated youth movement

Chicago journalists like Angela Caputo at the Tribune, Rob Wildeboer
at WBEZ, Jamie Kalven of the Invisible Institute, and staff of the
Chicago Reporter have contributed to this movement with their reporting.

Unlike traditional crime reporting, these journalists are focusing on
the systemic patterns and effects of our policing and criminal justice
system. They are joined by researcher/activists like Tracy Siska of
the Chicago Justice Project and Mariame Kaba of Prison Culture.

The main source for this type of reporting is data collected by
police, jails, courts, and prisons. This data is now starting to
become available at the scale necessary.

* In 2011, the City put crime report data on the city's data portal
* In 2013, Elliot Ramos of WBEZ, with the ACLU, make the first
  successful FOIA of CPD contact cards
* In 2015, Tracy Siska receives 10 years of criminal conviction data
  from the Circuit Court of Cook County
* In 2015, after a five year legal right, Jamie Kalven established
  that police complaint reports are public records and receives four
  years of data
* Additional data about the jail and prison systems can be extracted
  by scraping the Cook County Jail and IDOC websites

We've never had so much data about policing and criminal
justice. Unfortunately, mere access is not enough to enable the
reporting that will motivate change. These data are large and hard
to work with. Much of the reporter's time is spend cleaning up the
data, or getting in the right format, searching it, filtering it, or
linking it up with other data.

Much of that work is duplicated by every single journalist and
researcher working with this data. The difficulty of that work
prevents other workers from engaging with these new sources.

Instead of everyone doing this work separately and wastefully, we can
do it once and together. We can do the base data work that gets us to
the point of productivity, we can share skills on how to ask the
interesting questions of the data, and share skills for displaying our
findings in ways that are beautiful and touching.

# Shared Services
These data and this moment provide an opportunity to change the economics
of data intensive reporting and advocacy. By pooling resources, news and 
research organizations can pay once to have the basic, critical data work
done once for everone, and at a fraction of the cost for each organization.

As an honest broker, the McCormick Foundation can bring togethether 
distrustful competitors together to share the costs of necessary but
undifferentiating data work. 

# Sustainability
Data work has three moments

The moment of acquisition--recording and measuring
The moment of transformation--formatting, projecting, and reconciling
The moment of interpretation

Each of these moments have their costs. Reducing the costs of one of these moments increases demand for the others.

News organizations unique value is in the final moment, the moment of interpration--finding the patterns in the data. Historically, they have also had to bear the costs of acquisition and transformation even though those moments do not differentiate the newsroom's value.

Because of the open data movement, news organizations now have much cheaper costs to acquire data about how government, corporations, and other powerful institutions work. The costs of tranformation, though, remain unchanged and are still born by newsrooms.

Because of the beat structure of news, many of the transformations are common and repeated across newsrooms. If this data work could be done in common, it would lower the costs for all participating news organizations while freeing up some of the most valuable internal staff for more powerful interpretive work.

Policing and Public Safety are one beat ripe for a shared services models. But there are others.

## Politics
- Campaign finance data from the Illinois State Board of Elections
- Election results from Chicago, Cook County, and State
- Lobbying information at multiple levels
- Contract information at multiple levels
- Legislative information for City Council, Cook County, and State
- Dossiers on local and state politicans

## Local Business
- New construction permits
- Land sales
- Business permits
- Food inspections
- Movement of property though land review boards
- Tax Appeals
- Building violations
- Problem landlords

Building on the experience of working with reporters and research
organization focused on policing and public safety, the Associated
Data Agency will charge member organizations access to up-to-date,
accurate, ready-to-use data sourced from public bodies. On an ala
carte basis, members can get training and recieve consulting for their
deeper investigations.
