# Police, Public Safety, and Criminal Justice 

Nationally, we are in the beginning phase of a new civil rights
movement focused on the how we police people of colors. In our city
and state, the forces of this movement are well developed.

* A fiscal crisis that can let traditional law and order politicians
  be "smart on crime" and support alternative policies to current,
  expensive public safety policies.
* Active, public effort by the County and Sheriff to reduce
  incarceration.
* Local policy leaders in Restorative Justice and youth violence
* High capacity for research into public safety
  interventions by the Crimelab
* A growing, sophisticated youth movement

Chicago journalists like Angela Caputo at the Tribune, Rob Wildeboer
at WBEZ, Jamie Kalven of the Invisible Institute, and staff of the
Chicago Reporter are all covering public safety and contributing to
this movement.

Unlike traditional crime reporting, these journalists are focusing on
the systemic patterns and effects of our policing and criminal justice
system. They are joined by researcher/activists like Tracy Siska of
the Chicago Justice Project and Mariame Kaba of Prison Culture.

The main source for this type of reporting is data collected by
police, jails, courts, and prisons. This data is now starting to
become available at the scale necessary.

* In 2011, the City put crime report data on the city's data portal
* In 2013, Elliot Ramos of WBEZ, with the ACLU, make the first
  successful FOIA of CPD contact cards
* In 2015, Tracy Siska receives 10 years of criminal conviction data
  from the Circuit Court of Cook County
* In 2015, after a five year legal right, Jamie Kalven establishes
  that police complaint reports are public records and receives four
  years of data
* Additional data about the jail and prison systems can be extracted
  by scraping the Cook County Jail and IDOC websites

We've never had so much data about policing and criminal
justice. Unfortunately, mere access is not enough to enable the
reporting that will let motivate change. These data are large and hard
to work with. Much of the reporter's time is spend cleaning up the
data, or getting in the right format, searching it, filtering it, or
linking it up with other data.

Much of that work is duplicated by every single journalist and
researcher working with this data. The difficulty of that work
prevents other workers from engaging with these new sources.

Instead of everyone doing this work separately and wastefully, we can
do it once and together. We can do the base data work that gets us to
the point of productivity, we can share skills on how to ask the
interesting questions of the data, and share skills for displaying our
findings in ways that are beautiful and touching.
