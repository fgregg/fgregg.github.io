Liberalism is the major political philosophy of American civic
technology projects. Here, by liberalism, I mean the beliefs that
individual citizens know best their own interests; government must
have the consent of the people to be legitimate; and that government
should impinge upon the freedom of individuals as little as
possible. So, liberalism as in the Bill of Rights not as in NPR
listener.

Beyond it dominance in American society, liberalism is particularly
prominent within civic technology because of particular role that
information plays in liberal diagnoses of the problems of governments

Democratically elected governments sometimes act foolishly and
indecently and wreak great harm. A potential explanation of this fact
is that electorate is composed of people who are foolish, indecent,
and who want to wreak great harm. This is not an explanation that
liberalism can accept.

Liberals have always accepted that certain categories of people do not
have the capacity for the moral judgment required to be full
citizens. Currently, in the United States, these classes include
children, noncitizens, and in some states, the "mentally
incompetent," and people convicted of felonies. Historically, of course,
American liberalism also countenanced the disenfranchisement of women
and non-whites.

However, while the boundaries of who counts as a full citizen has
changed greatly, within the magic circle, there is no appetite to
grade who is wise and foolish, moral or wicked. Under liberalism,
the competence and legitimacy of fellow citizens is taken for
granted. This is a very nice thing about liberalism.

However, if the electorate is more or less good, then how do
understand when our government does things that are bad. One venerable
solution is to identify an enemy, foreign or domestic, that is
conspiring to subvert the will of the electorate. Richard
J. Hofstadter, "[The Paranoid Style in American
Politics](https://harpers.org/archive/1964/11/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics/)"
is the article to read about that.

The other major explanation is that the electorate hasn't been able to
get all the facts. If voters vote for bad governments, it's because
they don't know they are bad. People just need the right information.

If your job is in information technology, this diagnoses is
particularly beguiling. The problems of our democracy are precisely
those that you are have been trained to address. Here's the theory:
if you make it easier for voters to be informed, good things will be
sure to happen.

Here are some projects that I admire or was a part which tested that
theory.

* [Google Civic Information API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/)
* [Vote.org](https://www.vote.org/)

There are lots of others in this vein.

In my experience, some of these projects are very useful. But the ones
that I know intimately were not useful in way I hoped. Making information
about campaign finance or the activities of legislators much easier to
access has had very little direct influence on Chicago voters and through
them on capacity to govern ourselves well. These sites have found uses
and users but those users have not been the "the public," at least not
directly.

Okay, I think that's enough for this installment.
