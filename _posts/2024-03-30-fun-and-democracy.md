Nathan Schneider's book [*Governable
Spaces*](https://nathanschneider.info/books/governable-spaces/_ make
an explicitly Tocquevillian argument. Tocqueville argued that the
associational life of antebellum, white, male Americans gave them the
opportunities to practice collective decision making and group
problem-solving which taught them the skills and habits that
safeguarded the nation's democracy. Schneider argues that online
association life is typically authoritarian, what he calls implicit
feudalism, and that is teaching us to accept and even welcome
autocracy.

It is an incisive observation about online communities, and Schneider
does a good job tracing the authoritarian default of online spaces,
where typically the founders of an online group gets to make all the
rules for the group,

I don't really buy the argument the lack of democracy online is
leading us to fascism offline, but Schneider doesn't really put a lot
of force behind making that link. To be fair, I also don't really buy
Toqueville's original argument either.

Nevertheless, it could still be good for our online associational
lives to be more democratic, and Schneider presents a number of
creative ideas about how we could go about making that democracy
happen online.

But, here's the thing, Group decision making, democracy, politicsâ€”they
can be a real drag.

When I am thinking about the joining a website, of undertaking any new
activity, the promise of getting a chance to argue with strangers
about what we should do next is not a key selling point.  I may be
very grateful for democracy if I come to care deeply about the thing
and am worried about the direction it is going in, but it's not what
gets me in the door, and may well dissuade me from stepping through.

Most of people who buy a condo aren't doing it because they want a
condo board.

Most of the best fun I've had in my life have been in big group
projects that required lots of group decision making--putting together
community circuses, political activism, starting a business,
marriage. But, I've also spent a lot of time participating in group
decision making for endeavors and institutions that were very, very
far from the best fun. Democracy can be a joy, but it often isn't, and
I do wish the book attended more to designing for democratic joy.

Schneider returns often to Hirschman's classic enumerations of how
people can respond to a bad situation: loyalty, exit, and voice.

Under the authoritarian default of online spaces, our only recourse is
to exit. Schneider would like us to have effective voice.

But a democracy that's only important when things are dire doesn't
sound like a lot of fun.
