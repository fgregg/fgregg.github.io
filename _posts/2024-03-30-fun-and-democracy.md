Nathan Schneider's new book [*Governable
Spaces*](https://nathanschneider.info/books/governable-spaces/_)
revolves around the key observation that online associational life is
typically authoritarian in its governance, what he calls "implicit
feudalism." It's a really smart point, and Schneider does a good job
tracing the authoritarian default of online spaces, where typically
the founders of an online group get to make all the rules for the
group, indefinitely.

I don't really buy the grander claims that the lack of democracy online is
leading us to authoritarianism offline, but Schneider doesn't really put a lot
of force behind making that link. Nevertheless, it could still be good
for our online associational lives to be more democratic, and
Schneider presents a number of creative ideas about how we could go
about making that online democracy happen.

But, here's the thing, Group decision making, democracy, politicsâ€”they
can be a real drag.

When I am thinking about joining a website, the promise of getting a
chance to argue with strangers about what we should do next is not a
selling point. Later, if I come to care deeply, I may be very grateful
for the chance to have a say, but it's not what gets me in the door,
and may well dissuade me from stepping through.

Most of people who buy a condo aren't doing it because they want a
condo board.

Most of the best fun I've had in my life have been in big group
projects that required lots of group decision making--putting together
community circuses, political activism, starting a business,
marriage. But, I've also spent a lot of time participating in group
decision making for endeavors and institutions that were very, very
far from the best fun. Democracy can be a joy, but it often isn't. 
I do wish the book attended more to designing for democratic joy.

Schneider returns often to Hirschman's classic enumerations of how
people can respond to a bad situation: loyalty, exit, and voice. Under
the authoritarian default of online spaces, our only recourse is to
exit. Schneider would like us to have effective voice.

But a democracy that's only important when things are dire doesn't
sound like a lot of fun.
