#### Hiring
We finished a hiring round for a Developer I. Two things that were different 

1. we were open to US applicants in Pacific, Mountain, Central, and Eastern timezones (last time we excluded Pacific).
2. we implemented a [Rooney Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooney_Rule) for our interview stage.

I think both went well. Our applicant and interview pool was strong.

#### Union election delays
[Aaron Sojourner](https://twitter.com/aaronsojourner) asked me if I
had the distribution of the delays between when workers ask the NLRB
for an election and the election being held.

I put together a [Observable notebook to answer
that](https://observablehq.com/@fgregg/distribution-of-days-from-filing-to-first-election).

After I put together the initial histogram, I decided to look at it by
year. I'm glad I did because there was a pretty big change in 2015 due
to Obama era rule changes to shorten delays. h/t Dave Kamper.

I used a bit of code from [Ben Welsh](https://twitter.com/palewire) to
add a [download data link as spreadsheet
(csv)](https://observablehq.com/@palewire/saving-csv) to the
notebook. I'd like to do this for everything going forward.

#### Notices of initial bargaining
I submitted a FOIA for [notices of initial bargaining filed with
the
FMCS](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/voluntary-recognitions-october-1-2021-december-31-2021-122468/).

This FOIA may be helpful in identifying voluntary recognitions and
other union formations occuring outside of the NLRB. I suspect that
the [voluntary recognition notices filed to the NLRB are a partial
picture](https://labordata.bunkum.us/voluntary_recognitions).

[@UnionElections](https://twitter.com/UnionElections) sent me a list
of voluntary recognitions that he had compiled. When I get the [Q4
2022 voluntary recognition data from the
NLRB](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/voluntary-recognitions-october-1-2021-december-31-2021-122468/),
I want to compare the two lists and see what kind of differences there
are.

#### Gardening

We secure the same 25 x 15 plot we had last year. Some friends are
going to split the plot with us, which I'm excited about. Last year,
almost nothing we direct sowed came up, so that's something I want to
read about.

#### Managing meetings
The first two weeks of January had too many meetings. I'd like to
build a little github action app that sets a budget of the number of
hours of meetings i can be schedule for during a week by hooking into
the Calendly and Google Calendar APIs. Sounds like a yak i shouldn't
shave, but I might.

#### Chicago Journalist Association
I got DataMade's plaque from the Chicago Journalist Association for our
first place award of Best Series for the [The Circuit](https://thecircuit.cc/).
