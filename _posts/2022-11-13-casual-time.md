description: What fits into fragmented time?
---

[I've been thinking about the type of time I have these
days](https://bunkum.us/2022/11/06/asynch-civics.html): time that is
interrupted; interruptible; passing at places not fully under my
control; and during which I usually need to give low-grade attention
to something else.

What fits into those times, and what can I make to fit?

Activities that fit have these qualities:
* Can do anywhere
* Don’t require co-presence or co-attention with specific people
* Can be paused indefinitely

I've been thinking of these as "casual activities." 

Examples of casual activities:

| No phone | With phone |
|-|-|
| Knitting | Texting with friends |
| Looking at plants or telecom equipment | Playing casual games like candy crush or duolingo |
| Thinking about things | Social media |
| Not thinking about things | Listening to music | 
| Whittling | Reading | 

<br />
I've been trying to make some other activities I want to want to do
more casual. If activities can fit better into my life, my hope is
that I will more of them.

[Datasette](https://datasette.io/),
[Observable](https://observablehq.com/@fgregg), and GitHub Actions
make data analysis much more casual. It's not pleasant to write SQL on
a phone, and even worse to write JavaScript, but it’s possible to do
casually now.

This is the second post I've initially drafted in the notes app of my
phone. Again, it's not a great way to write, but it make writing
casual.

I've been debating about whether casual qualities have another
necessary property: discreetness. I have everything I need to do a few
push-ups, stretch out my hamstrings, or practice harmonica while
hanging at the playground, but it seems too embarrassing to draw that
attention to myself.

But I'm not sure that's right. Maybe i need to just get over it.

A lot of the internet depends on taking our casual time, but I haven't
been able to find good writing about it.  I'm sure it’s out there and
if you know about it, please send it my way.
