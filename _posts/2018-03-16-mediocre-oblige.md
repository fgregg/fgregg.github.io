Civic tech, or at least my work in it, is largely about helping
other people or improving some aspect of society for the public. It
has not been about technologists using their technical skills and
social power to advance their own material interests.

Such movements, of course, exist -- the free software movement and
the electronic civil liberties are two clear examples. However, the
civic technologist labors for somebody else, or for everybody
else, which is about the same thing.

This dislocation has a few sources.

One, a political program of empowering technologists, as a group,
is not inspiring. As a group of workers, technologists are among
the highest paid and highest status. From the outside, they are
not the group I would prioritize to provide additional power and
privileges. So, just as a matter of Darwinian selection, civic
technologists argue that their work is for someone
else. Arguments to justify government spending on open data, or
grant funding for a civic tech project are made in terms of the
benefit to some other public. People who don't make these types
of arguments don't survive in civic tech, (not that many people
do regardless). Please note that I am not saying these arguments
are disingenuous.

Second, many of the technologists in civic tech are well aware
how much better they have things than almost everyone else. They
understand that they enjoy their position because of their
command of a set of technical skills and capacities that are
socially powerful. If they lent some of these special powers for
good, that would be good. Many people come to civic tech with
this redistributional mindset, a kind of noblesse oblige or maybe
m√©diocre oblige.

This mindset sensitizes the technologist to their privileges, the
often vast gulfs between status and material comfort between
technologists and our neighbors. Insofar, as technologists are
predominantly male, white, straight, and otherwise socially
normative, these examinations and privileges can be far reaching
indeed. In attending to inequity, the civic technologist often
looks for opportunities to help close this gap. This typically
turns into the idea of helping other people do better, instead of
lowering the technologists own social position.

Third, as is probably true of most Americans, the people who are
civic technologists don't think of their own problems as
public problems.

Let me make this a bit more concrete. I have a young son, less
than two years old, and I live in a large American city. I'd like
my son to go to a school that he enjoys and helps him
flourish. Figuring out if that can happen for him in the public
schools of Chicago is a source of concern, anxiety, and much,
much, much discussion with friends who also have small
children. In these discussions, we talk about we can do as
families -- move to a neighborhood with a school with a good
reputation, try to navigate the selective enrollment process, or
consider private schools.

We don't talk about organizing together to demand that every
school in Chicago is wonderful. It's not because that seems
like an large and indefinite amount of work. The strategy just
doesn't come up. For us, getting a good education for our
children is each family's responsibility, not a public
responsibility.

This lack of imagination is the difference between privilege and
power.

I would like to live in a school district where the decision of
where to send you kid was of absolutely no consequence, because
all the schools would good. And not for equity, for my own self
interest.

I would like to move into any apartment or house and
not worry that it was poisoning my child. And not for equity, but
for my own self interest.

As a South Sider, I would like it if the Metra Electric District had
regular, frequent service and not just at rush hour. And not for
equity, but for my own self interest.

What would happen if civic technologists looked to their own
lives and thought about their problems as public? It is certainly
true that if we are concerned with equity, we will recognize that
solving some of our problems would bring harm to people more
oppressed than us. However, for many problems, we might actually
recognize the other not as someone for us to aid, but someone to
struggle with.
