I've been slowly reading *[The Government
Machine](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/government-machine)* by Jon
Apgar. The book is a history of the uses of information and
information technology in late 19th and early 20th century
Britain. It's also one of the most useful books I've read about the
open gov, open data, and civic tech movements.

Apgar's unfolds a story about a series of "expert movements" to get
the British government to collect information about its peoples,
industry, and governmental operations and to appropriately use that
information for effective and efficient government. The conflicts,
organizational forms, and even personality types should be familiar
those who have been taken part in similar movements in the early 21st
century.

Many of Apgar's analyses and and critiques of our Victorians and
Edwardians predecessors still slice. It's a good book and I recommend it.

Today, I want to talk about one part in particular. In Apgar's
account, the leadership of the British civil service was ready to
adopt office machines (like card sorters and punch cards) because
there was already a mental and bureaucratic division between the
leadership of the civil service who made and directed policy and the
lower ranks that carried them out. Indeed, the lower ranks were
already sometimes described as "mechanical."

The elites of the civil service, at worst, did not see mechanization
as a threat, and often saw it natural and reinforcing the division
between the thinking part (what they did) and the execution what the
clerks and secretaries and the rest of the apparatus did.

To put it coarsely, the introduction of mechanized office machinery
and tabulation fit the worldview and class interests of the civil
service elites, which made it relatively easy to mechanize the civil
service.

Putting aside whether Agar's claim is true in fact, it seems like the 
"digital services" and egovernment movements have not had the same alignment 
with the worldview and class interests of top bureaucrats in their age.

Indeed, it has often seemed to be opposed to it. Proponents of these
movements have often positioned them as about introducing different
values into government as much as, if not more so, then introducing
new technology.

I truly dont' really know how true this is. I don't really have the
intimacy with the leaderships of governmental departments to speak to
their worldview or interests as group. Still, it has me asking a few
questions.


* Is there a version of egovernment or digital services that is
  *aligned* with the class interests and worldview of top bureaucrats?
  Is this how to understand "Smart Cities"? Is this the way to read
  whatever it is that [Dominic Cummings](https://dominiccummings.com/2020/01/02/two-hands-are-a-lot-were-hiring-data-scientists-project-managers-policy-experts-assorted-weirdos/) is up to?
* Is there a reframing of egovernment or digital services that could make it
  aligned with the interests of top bureaucrats **and** still command
  the loyalty of current partisans?
* If the obstacle are values, should we read the "[Public Interest](https://www.newamerica.org/public-interest-technology/blog/defining-public-interest-technology/)"
  movement as attempt to indoctrinate different values into the top
  bureaucrats of tomorrow?
